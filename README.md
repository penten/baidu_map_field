Drupal 7 compatible

This module adds a field allowing to display a google map.

If multiple entries are added to the field, a single map will be displayed with a marker pin for each entry.

Custom marker icons and styling can be chosen from the configuration page.

You will need a Baidu map API key to use this module correctly.
